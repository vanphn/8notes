							<h1>8Notes Redesign</h1>
							<h3 style="color:#a8a8a8;">DH 110: User Experience Design</h3>
							<h3>Project Overview</h3>
							<p>8notes is a redesigned mobile app focused on providing free sheet music to all music learners. It is especially catered for beginners to find communities through the forum as well as provide fundamental learning resources such as lessons, tools, and more.</p>
							<h3>My Background</h3>
							<p>Hello, I’m Vanessa Phan. I designed the user experience and interface of this app as part of my Digital Humanities 110 course project @ UCLA. We covered the basics of UX design methods, including field research, wireframing, and prototyping.

				<!-- Design Statement -->

						<div class="content">
							<h2>Design Statement</h2>
							<p>For adults, learning a new skill can often be a daunting and difficult process. While research reveals that learning to play music can have many health and lifestyle benefits such as improved memory and muscle coordination, this endeavor is often ill-designed for adults since most music teaching institutions are often catered towards children. This project focuses on investigating, understanding, and implementing new designs to create a more pleasant user experience while keeping in mind the targeted demographic of middle-aged individuals who struggle to find resources and a sense of community during their learning journey. </p>

							<h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
							<p>To understand the current music learning platforms that currently exist on the Internet, I conducted a competitor analysis on two websites that both offer free lessons on music lessons and music theory. The first site, Teoria, heavily focuses on music theory and provides extensive practice lessons that users can modify. While the site is very useful for learning music theory, it is more geared towards intermediate or advanced users who are looking to hone their skills. On the other hand, 8notes provides beginners lessons in music theory in addition to providing other resources once they are done with the lesson. Users can begin to use their music theory knowledge to browse through the site’s huge archive of music sheets or begin music lessons for specific instruments. Ultimately, I decided to delve further into the features and functionality of 8notes for this project. <p>

						</div>
						<p>The next step in my research was to conduct a usability test of the website to see how a user would interact with the platform. The key takeaways were:</p>
						<ul>
							<li> The participant heavily utilized the search bar. </li>
							<li> They had a difficult time finding the forum page.</li>
							<li>The website looked and feel outdated and contains too many elements.</li>
						</ul>

								<h2> UX Storytelling </h2>
								<p>
									<span class="image right">
										<img src="images/persona.png" alt="">
									</span>
										To better understand and empathize with the user’s needs and desires, I created 2 different persona to help aid me in building a better product.
										<ul>
											<li>Roy is a 58 years old man and  has been working as an electrical engineer for 25 years and recently retired. He has been considering learning a new instrument in his free time but is not sure where to start. He hopes to find a network of novice players in order to make friends and make learning more fun.</li>
											<li>Elliot is a 36 years old music enthusiast who enjoys playing guitar and singing. He is currently working as a bank teller for his daytime job but can often be seen at pubs and open mics events performing music on the side. He is thinking of quitting his job and pursuing music full time but still wants to hone his music skills for a little while. </li>
										</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									Consequently, this allowed me to create an empathy map and allowed me to step into the shoes of the users in order to create designs that are most suitable for their needs. With these personas in mind, I create 2 main tasks:
										<ul>
											<li>Allow users to connect with others by posting their thoughts and questions on the forum </li>
											<li>Give users to ability to sort through sheet music to their preference</li>
										</ul>
