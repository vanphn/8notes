							<h1>8Notes Redesign</h1>
							<h3 style="color:#a8a8a8;">DH 110: User Experience Design</h3>
							<h3>Project Overview</h3>
							<p>8notes is a redesigned mobile app focused on providing free sheet music to all music learners. It is especially catered for beginners to find communities through the forum as well as provide fundamental learning resources such as lessons, tools, and more.</p>
							<h3>My Background</h3>
							<p>Hello, I’m Vanessa Phan. I designed the user experience and interface of this app as part of my Digital Humanities 110 course project @ UCLA. We covered the basics of UX design methods, including field research, wireframing, and prototyping.

				<!-- Design Statement -->

						<div class="content">
							<h2>Design Statement</h2>
							<p>For adults, learning a new skill can often be a daunting and difficult process. While research reveals that learning to play music can have many health and lifestyle benefits such as improved memory and muscle coordination, this endeavor is often ill-designed for adults since most music teaching institutions are often catered towards children. This project focuses on investigating, understanding, and implementing new designs to create a more pleasant user experience while keeping in mind the targeted demographic of middle-aged individuals who struggle to find resources and a sense of community during their learning journey. </p>

				<!-- Competitor Analysis -->

						<div class="content">
							<h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
							<p>To understand the current music learning platforms that currently exist on the Internet, I conducted a competitor analysis on two websites that both offer free lessons on music lessons and music theory. The first site, <a href="https://www.teoria.com/">Teoria</a>, heavily focuses on music theory and provides extensive practice lessons that users can modify. While the site is very useful for learning music theory, it is more geared towards intermediate or advanced users who are looking to hone their skills. On the other hand, 8notes provides beginners lessons in music theory in addition to providing other resources once they are done with the lesson. Users can begin to use their music theory knowledge to browse through the site’s huge archive of music sheets or begin music lessons for specific instruments. Ultimately, I decided to delve further into the features and functionality of 8notes for this project. <p>

				<!-- User Research -->
				<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>User Research</h2>
						<h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
						<p>In order to hone a better understanding of my target audience and immerse myself in the user’s mindset, I utilized a qualitative research method through contextual inquiry and interviewed people that would most fit the user archetype. These were men older than 25 who have had no prior experience with formal music training and would be interested in self-learning music. I then prepared questions and hypotheticals to gauge what the user could potentially be interested in and/or looking for when starting to learn music.</p>

						<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
						<p>Since I would be developing ideas from the pre-existing features of the original 8notes websites. I created a list of tasks that I believe would be commonly used by learners. I then conducted usability testing with a participant close to the target user in order to identify pain points as well as their usability habits. The key takeaways were:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Participant had a difficult time finding the forum page</li>
							<li>Complained that the website looks outdated, affecting how trustworthy they found the site to be.</li>
							<li>Complained that the visuals on the main page were overwhelming</li>
							<li>The participants heavily utilized the search bar when they were unable to complete certain tasks with the navigation</li>

								<h2> UX Storytelling </h2>
								<p>
									<span class="image right">
										<img src="images/persona.png" alt="">
									</span>
										Gathering insight from the user research interviews, my understanding of the user’s need, and the existing music learning platform, I created 2 personas that would best represent the typical users of the product:
										<ul>
											<li>Roy is a 58 years old man and  has been working as an electrical engineer for 25 years and recently retired. He has been considering learning a new instrument in his free time but is not sure where to start. He hopes to find a network of novice players in order to make friends and make learning more fun.</li>
											<li>Elliot is a 36 years old music enthusiast who enjoys playing guitar and singing. He is currently working as a bank teller for his daytime job but can often be seen at pubs and open mics events performing music on the side. He is thinking of quitting his job and pursuing music full time but still wants to hone his music skills for a little while. </li>
										</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="image left">
										<img src="images/journey.png" alt="">
									</span>
									Through the personas, I was then able to identify their pain points and create a journey map for the types of goals and resolution they were likely to have. This process required me to summarize what I had discovered from previous research and interviews. I then created two tasks that would be most fitting for the app as well as created usage scenarios based on those tasks:
									<ul>
										<li>Allow users to connect with others by posting their thoughts and questions on the forum</li>
										<li>Give users to ability to sort through sheet music to their preference</li>
									</ul>

							<div class="content">
								<h2> Lo-Fi Wireframing </h2>
								<p> Through the process of user research and interviews, I began to sketch out my vision for what the tasks would be like on an interface. At the same time, I needed to keep in mind the logical steps the users would take to finish the tasks. The low-fidelity prototypes were completed through Whimsical. This process allowed me to move things around in a way that would make the features most cohesive. I found that even though I did a initial paper sketch, a lot can change once I started putting those ideas into a digital wireframe </p>

								<div class="content">
									<h2> Interface Design System</h2>
									<p>With the low-fidelity prototypes, my next steps were to construct a design system to have consistency across my design and later communicate them with other people. I chose to use a variation of the original color scheme from the 8Notes website in order to connect the online and mobile app as one platform. The color palette that I created is bright yet simple and modern which is slightly different from the original. I then checked each color against each other as well as the font color for accessibility and contrast. I also added icons where it would be helpful to make the features more interactive and fun.</p>

						<!-- High Fidelity Prototype -->
							<section class="banner style1 orient-left content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in">
								<div class="content">
									<h2>High Fidelity Prototype</h2>
									<p>After getting feedback on my low-fidelity designs, the last step was to create a high fidelity interactive prototype. This was done by transferring my prototypes that were initially constructed on Sketch over to Figma. Afterwards, I began the iterative process of evaluation and revision based on cognitive walkthrough in order to arrive at the final version of my design. With the help of my participants, I made changes to the color scheme, headings, iconography, as well as added more functionality into the features such as allowing users to make changes to the body text. </p>

										<h2>Conclusion</h2>
										<p>This course was my first experience completing one round of the UX design process. I discovered how detail oriented each step of the process is and quickly learned the importance of keeping in mind standard and consistency. When conducting user research and personas, I found that it was a different experience creating a product whose target user is not myself, which required me to think beyond what is helpful to me and extend to a more general demographic. My biggest lessons from this process was to always take the time and care into each step of my design as they will heavily influence later iterations of the app. Additionally, always keeping in mind the target user and the current technological landscape was a significant part of UX design that I came to learn.</p>
										<p>I gained a significant amount of knowledge through this course and the guidance of Professor Sookie at UCLA. Although we are learning about UI/UX, I gained interpersonal skills such as interviewing and active listening, as well as time-management, problem solving, attention to detail, and more.</p>
